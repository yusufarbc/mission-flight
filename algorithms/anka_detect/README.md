# anka_detect

Team-specific detection utilities and a short demo clip that illustrates our target-highlighting approach.

## Files

- `team_detection_demo.py` - Minimal example that runs the detector and renders bounding boxes.
- `demo_video.mp4` - Recorded demo of the detection output.

## Usage

```powershell
pip install opencv-python numpy
python team_detection_demo.py
```

Make sure a webcam or test video source is available; the script opens the default capture device.
