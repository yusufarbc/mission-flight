Assets
------

This folder contains static assets used by the repository.

- `logo.png`: Team logo image (not included by default). You can generate a placeholder using `create_logo.py`.
- `create_logo.py`: Small helper script that writes a tiny placeholder PNG to `logo.png`.

To create the placeholder logo (PowerShell):

```powershell
python assets\create_logo.py
```

Replace `logo.png` with your real team logo file (same filename) when ready.
